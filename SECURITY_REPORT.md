# Security Audit Report

## Date: 2025-08-11

## Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on this Next.js portfolio application. Several vulnerabilities were identified and fixed. The application is now secure with proper input validation, updated dependencies, and comprehensive security headers.

## Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical: Next.js Security Vulnerabilities (FIXED ✓)

**Issue**: Next.js version 15.1.5 had multiple critical vulnerabilities:
- Race Condition to Cache Poisoning (GHSA-qpjv-v59x-3qc4)
- Information exposure in dev server (GHSA-3h52-269p-cp9r)
- DoS via cache poisoning (GHSA-67rr-84xm-4c7r)
- Authorization Bypass in Middleware (GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)

**Fix**: Updated Next.js from 15.1.5 to 15.4.6
```bash
npm install next@15.4.6
```

### 2. High: Path Traversal Vulnerability (FIXED ✓)

**Issue**: The `getProjectBySlug` function in `/src/lib/projects.ts` was vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive input validation:
- Sanitized slug to only allow alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- Added explicit checks for directory traversal patterns (.., /, \)
- Implemented path resolution checks to ensure files are within the projects directory

### 3. Medium: Missing Security Headers (FIXED ✓)

**Issue**: The application was missing important security headers that protect against various attacks.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.ts`:
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection for older browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive CSP to prevent XSS and injection attacks

### 4. Low: SVG Security Configuration (FIXED ✓)

**Issue**: The `dangerouslyAllowSVG` flag was set to true, which could allow malicious SVG files to execute scripts.

**Fix**: Removed the `dangerouslyAllowSVG` flag from the Next.js configuration. SVGs should be sanitized before use or served as static files.

### 5. Low: Incomplete .gitignore (FIXED ✓)

**Issue**: The .gitignore file was missing some patterns for sensitive files.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive patterns to .gitignore:
- `.env` (in addition to `.env.local`)
- `.env.production` and `.env.development`
- Security certificate patterns (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.crt`, `*.cer`)

## Security Checks Performed

### ✓ Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Ran `npm audit` and fixed all vulnerabilities
- All dependencies are now up to date with no known vulnerabilities

### ✓ Secret Scanning
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials found in the codebase
- Environment variables are properly handled

### ✓ Input Validation
- Path traversal protection implemented
- Dynamic routes properly sanitized

### ✓ XSS Protection
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage found
- No `eval()` or `new Function()` usage
- Comprehensive CSP headers implemented
- React's built-in XSS protection is active

### ✓ Authentication & Authorization
- No authentication system implemented (portfolio is public)
- No sensitive operations that require authorization

### ✓ SQL Injection
- No database connections or SQL queries found
- Application uses file-based content (MDX files)

### ✓ CSRF Protection
- No forms or state-changing operations that require CSRF tokens
- Application is primarily read-only

### ✓ File Upload Security
- No file upload functionality present

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated, especially Next.js and React
2. **Security Monitoring**: Consider adding security monitoring tools like Snyk or GitHub Security Alerts
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure the application is always served over HTTPS in production
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting if adding any API endpoints
5. **Input Validation**: Continue to validate all user inputs if new features are added

## Conclusion

All identified security vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed. The application now follows security best practices with:
- Updated dependencies with no known vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive security headers
- Proper input validation
- Secure configuration

The portfolio application is now secure for production deployment.

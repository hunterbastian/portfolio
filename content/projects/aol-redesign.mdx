# Case Study - AOL App

## Introduction

For my communicating design class, I was tasked to recreate AOL's mail app. Starting with the beginning, I wanted to give the app a new direction in its feel, as the current AOL map feels outdated and was also confusing for the users it was trying to appeal to, which were generally older people even though some younger people use them as well.

## Mood Boards and Sketches

I started with mood boards as well as sketches, which was very helpful as my exploratory phase in finding inspiration for what modem email applications look like, and since this was focused on desktop and mobile, I was looking for both so I could get a wide range of inspiration, as I am designing for mobile and desktop.

## Wireframes

I set out to find a balance between keeping the AOL app and website app not too busy but also leaning into a new direction with simplicity in mind.

## Surface Comps

Setting out to complete the final step of the AOL app redesign, I did surface comps. I went for the clean colors of green and yellow, drawing inspiration from soft mint and lemon palettes. I believe my redesign of the AOL app is much more user friendly and easier to navigate.

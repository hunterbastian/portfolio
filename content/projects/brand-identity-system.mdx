A final project for my Immersive Experiences I Design class — an interactive Framer site that lets users explore locations from Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Key features include a clickable map that scrolls to detailed location cards, an old-map visual aesthetic in warm greens, and content designed to work for both newcomers and longtime fans of the series.

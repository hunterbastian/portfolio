# Building a Journey through Middle-Earth

## Intro

Final project "A Journey through Middle-Earth" Mini Website for my Immersive Experiences I Design class. Had a lot of fun working on this and learned how to use Framer in depth. The website allows users to explore locations from Middle-Earth, drawing inspiration from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings books and movies.

## Thought process...

I needed to decide how I was going to go about giving the user an actual useful guide to the universe of Lord of the Rings. What features should I add that would help expand the experience for someone who is new? What about someone who is already very familiar with Lord of the Rings?

I also decided to use Framer as my website builder as it offers a clean start with useful interface features and interactions.

## First feature

I landed on creating my first feature which involved the map of the Lord of the Rings.

&nbsp;

One of the main features of the website is an interactive map. When users hover over a location on the map, a label appears, and clicking on a location, like Mirkwood, scrolls the user down to a detailed card for that location.

&nbsp;

This would help the user visualize the geography and locations of the universe, as well as something they can interact with and since it's tangible it can help them understand the map.

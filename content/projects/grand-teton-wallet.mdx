# Grand Teton Wallet

## Intro and Problem Statement

Grand Teton Wallet, designed in Figma. I used one of the pictures I took at Grand Teton National Park this fall for the front. The problem I had was most adventure inspired wallets didn't retain a premium aesthetic that I am trying to go for here. Translating the mountain design on the front should be able to be displayed well.

## Systems

Designed in Figma, I came up with this minimalist bifold wallet inspired by my trip to the Grand Teton in 2024.

**Materials:** Limited to one or two leather tones and one stitch color.

**Manufacturing:** Avoid complex cuts that increase cost and retain capacity for 6–8 cards + cash but still retain a premium aesthetic.

## Conclusion

This wallet converts the combination of premium materials with a Grand Teton contour that mixes adventure and an elevated aesthetic. I came to this wallet as my design conclusion and will test further possibilities.

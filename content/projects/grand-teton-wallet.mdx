A Figma concept for a premium bifold wallet inspired by my 2024 trip to Grand Teton National Park. The design translates a mountain contour photograph into a minimal leather product — constrained to two leather tones, one stitch color, and 6–8 card capacity — balancing adventure aesthetic with a clean, elevated finish.

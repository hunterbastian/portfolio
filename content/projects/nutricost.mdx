# Case Study - Nutricost

**Hunter Bastian**

## Overview

The summary of the product I was designing for my graphic design internship was product label designs for health supplements of online images that would go on the company website or Amazon.

## The Challenge

This project needed to happen because product labels were constantly being updated with new information or regulations, because these products were health supplements. The desired outcome was to have everything updated for the most recent information.

## The User

The user or the person who would use this product would be the person purchasing the health supplement online. This person would probably be more into health related things, needs something for vitamins, is interested in staying healthy or supplements for working out.

## The Process

I would design or redesign product labels for these products with the most recent information and designs, mainly working in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. There were other graphic designers on the team but I mainly worked with the associate creative director on these designs.

We didn't have many constraints overall but we had to be making sure we get the information in correctly, and get the designs updated in time before the websites would refresh with the new product labels for the health supplements.

## Step by Step Run Down

I would enter the office, sit at my desk, and login to the Mac.

Then, I would launch the company's file drive and set up my windows accordingly, as well as check my email.

I would then open up the marketing design queue which was the main area I found my work in everyday. The most recent design requests would go here.

I would choose the most urgent or recent one and start working on it, going through it with my step by step design process.

I did it this way so I made sure I could answer any emails before starting more focused work that would take a longer time. This allowed me to still stay up to date on what was happening with our design production but also have dedicated time for focused work.

## Results

In the end the designs were being turned in correctly and efficiently, though different processes could be improved upon like having a more organized design queue, which would have let me work faster in which would also equal being more efficient with time. Overall this was a successful internship and I quite enjoyed my time there!

At Nutricost, I had the opportunity to work on various labels designs for products.

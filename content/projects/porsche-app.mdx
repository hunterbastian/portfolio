## Intro and Problem Statement

This was an app concept I designed and coded and was inspired by the Porsche website. I wanted to make a simple app interface that you could look at all the Porsche vehicles and understand what they are and statistics and such.

If you look at the Porsche website it can be a bit overwhelming, so I wanted to solve this problem by creating an app interface that you could easily understand Porsche vehicles.

## Systems

Using HTML and CSS and also design principles I created this app concept.

## Conclusion

This served as a valuable lesson in creating an app for a problem I found on the main website.

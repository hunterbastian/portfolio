# WanderUtah

<img src="/images/projects/wanderutah.png" alt="WanderUtah" />

## Introduction

WanderUtah is a mobile app concept designed to help users discover, plan, and learn about Utah's five iconic national parks, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion. The app combines tools like event calendars and park information with a clean nature-inspired visual design and aesthetic.

## What Happened

WanderUtah helps users explore Utah's five national parks through a calm, minimal, and visually inspired experience. Starting with sketches, I created mood boards, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs in Figma that highlight each park's unique landscape and color palette. The app features a simple navigation system, event calendar, and park detail pages that blend functionality with visual storytelling. This project allowed me to transform an idea into a well-thought-out design system that combines usability and emotion to encourage people to discover Utah's natural beauty.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot from this project and I designed WanderUtah to be a minimalist app that helps users explore and plan trips to Utah's five national parks through clean design and intuitive navigation. The project went from sketches to high-fidelity Figma prototypes blending functionality and visuals to inspire appreciation for Utah's natural beauty and our national parks.

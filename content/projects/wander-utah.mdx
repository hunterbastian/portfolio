# WanderUtah

Documentation - High-Fidelity Immersive Experience

WanderUtah App

## Why you chose your topic

I chose my topic because I love hiking, and have a great interest in exploring and the National Parks. I have been to Zion, Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef, and eventually plan to go to Canyonlands and Arches.

## Why you chose the channel you did

Setting out to design an app based on Utah's national parks was an intriguing way to have a good challenge as I haven't done a deep dive into UI design like this before and working with design systems. Reflecting on an app based on the idea of the national parks here in Utah just seemed like such a great way to captivate my adventurous spirit, and showing those design details in the app showcasing Utah's national parks was a great design practice.

## How you wanted to use media to help tourists or give people more information

This app was designed to help people learn more about Utah's National Parks through media like pictures and explaining each park as well as a calendar to give them more information about upcoming events and plan those times in app, like camping and park events.

## How you created your content and the final look and feel

I created my design and content for the design in Figma, I drew inspiration from the way Utah's national parks feel - the red rocks, tall earthy cliffs, and towering mountains. I wanted to reflect these feelings in the app as you use it.

## Conclusion

Overall I am glad I was able to gain the experience to work on this app and also create an experience that could help a lot of Utah's tourists and visitors of the national parks here, and help them learn more about our parks!

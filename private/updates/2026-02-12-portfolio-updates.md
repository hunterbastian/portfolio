# Portfolio Updates - February 12, 2026

1. Added a new 2026-present founder experience entry for Studio Alpine in the resume-style experience list.
2. Updated the founder description copy so it reads "Founder of Studio Alpine" instead of "Studio Space Alpine."
3. Restored monotype styling to section headers and key metadata labels to bring back the terminal feel.
4. Forced section header labels to render in uppercase for consistent terminal-style headings.
5. Switched case-study card titles to monotype styling for stronger visual consistency with the section UI.
6. Kept case-study body content (paragraphs and lists) in Inter for better readability inside opened case studies.
7. Switched expanded experience description paragraphs to Inter so long text blocks are easier to read.
8. Left-aligned section plus/X toggle icons across viewport sizes so the toggle position is consistent.
9. Increased section label stagger strength with adjusted timing, blur, and scale values to make the reveal more noticeable.
10. Added one-time initial-load sequencing so visible top sections reveal in order: Contact, then Creating, then Case Studies.
11. Added a matching initial delay for the Case Studies grid so cards do not reveal too early relative to section timing.
12. Added a very subtle blur fade on collapsible section enter/exit motion to soften transitions.
13. Added a very subtle blur fade on case-study grid entrance so it matches the section motion language.
14. Added a new bottom Education entry for the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, issued in 2021.
15. Temporarily lowercased several company and school names during copy tuning, then restored proper title case based on feedback.
16. Restored title case for Studio Alpine, Catapult, Utah Valley University, Columbus State Community College, Nutricost, Clutch, Google, and IT Support Professional Certificate.
17. Preserved the requested typography split where terminal-style labels remain stylistic and paragraph-style content stays readable.
18. Deployed each approved round of changes to production on hunterbastian.com after push validation.
